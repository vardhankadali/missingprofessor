                <h3>It seems that the professor came here to order the medicine Fluticasone for her asthma. Her house is 10 km to the north and her office is 8 km to the south from here. The pharmacist says that she went east after leaving the pharmacy. After going east for 500 meters, you find a CCTV footage at a traffic signal, where she turned right. She seems to have gone straight in that direction to reach her destination. You might find more clues at that destination.</h3>
